            <h2>Starter Feed</h2>
            <p>
                Starter feed is designed for baby chicks. It is high in protein (around 20-24%) to support rapid growth
                and development.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fine texture for easy eating</li>
                <li>Fed from hatch to 6 weeks</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="grower">
            <h2>Grower Feed</h2>
            <p>
                Grower feed is given to adolescent chickens, usually from 6 to 20 weeks old. It contains less protein
                than starter feed (16-18%) and helps chickens grow at a healthy rate.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Supports steady growth</li>
                <li>Prepares pullets for laying</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="layer">
            <h2>Layer Feed</h2>
            <p>
                Layer feed is formulated for hens that are laying eggs. It contains extra calcium to support eggshell
                production and has balanced nutrients for adult chickens.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fed from 20 weeks onward</li>
                <li>Higher calcium content</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="scratch">
            <h2>Scratch Grains</h2>
            <p>
                Scratch grains are a mix of cracked corn and other grains. They are not a complete feed but are given as
                a treat to encourage natural foraging behavior.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Should be fed in moderation</li>
                <li>Not nutritionally complete</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="treats">
            <h2>Treats & Supplements</h2>
            <p>
                Chickens enjoy treats like fruits, vegetables, and mealworms. Supplements such as oyster shell and grit
                help with digestion and eggshell quality.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Offer treats sparingly</li>
                <li>Provide grit for digestion</li>
            </ul>
